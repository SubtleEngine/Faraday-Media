# Faraday Media

This repository contains an unofficial directory of over 640 video and audio files of lectures, panel discussions and seminars published by the [Faraday Institutute](https://faraday-institute.org/).

The directory includes title, description, keywords and a link to the a page on the University of Cambridge's [Streaming Media Service](https://sms.cam.ac.uk/) where the media can be streamed or downloaded.

Filter the CSV by keyword to see relevant files e.g. nanotech or artificial intelligence.

For example, here's [Artificial Intelligence: it's Future and Ours](sms.cam.ac.uk/media/2455141), a 2017 discussion with John Wyatt, Abigail Sellen, Adrian Weller, Margaret Boden and Jaan Tallinn, or Michael Burdett on [Human Enhancement: Ethical and Theological Issues](sms.cam.ac.uk/media/2046409) from 2015.

The Faraday website has a great back-catalogue of talks on religion, science and technology. This directory lists its media in one place to help people explore and search for interesting discussions.
